This repository contains the code necessary to calculate the quantities used in Lark et al. (submitted to GRL, 2021).

The following files illustrate the use of the code by generating the quantities plotted in the paper.
By figure:
- Figure 1: quantity_of_sulfides.m
- Figure 2: C_m_implications_by_S.m
- Figure 3 and 4: C_implications_by_S.m
- Figure S1: mantle_density_structure.m
- Figures S2: modify C_implications_by_S.m where indicated.
- Figure S3: SI_C_implications_by_S_Ca.m
- Figures S4, S5, and S6: SI_C_implications_by_S_core_nonideal_FeSi, SI_C_implications_by_S_core_FeS, and SI_C_implications_by_S_core_Csat_FeSi
