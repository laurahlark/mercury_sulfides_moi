This repository contains the code necessary to calculate the quantities used in Lark et al. (submitted to GRL, 2021).

The following files illustrate the use of the code by generating the quantities plotted in the paper.
By figure:
- Figure 1: quantity_of_sulfides.m
- Figure 2: I_m_implications_by_S.m
- Figure 3 and 4: I_implications_by_S.m
- Figure S1: mantle_density_structure.m
- Figures S2 and S3: modify I_implications_by_S.m where indicated.
- Figures S4, S5, and S6: alternate_alloys.m, I_implications_by_S.m modified where indicated.
- Figure S7: explore_sensitivity_core.m
